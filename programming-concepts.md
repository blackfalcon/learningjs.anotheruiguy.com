# JavaScript Programming Concepts

JavaScript Programming Concepts consists of three individual day-long sessions. Each session will consist of education modules that includes topic discussion and workshop labs.

This course will focus on teaching software engineers the core concepts of modern JavaScript development. Students will progress from foundational JavaScript to advanced concepts and beyond. The instructional style is designed to help draw parallels between JavaScript and the student's current programming background.

## What you'll learn

**JavaScript Core Concepts:**
Students will be walked through the essentials of JavaScript. Material will cover the foundational building blocks of the language and how they may differ from other languages.

**JavaScript Advanced Concepts:**
Students will be walked through some advanced concepts of JavaScript. Material will cover the growing scope of the language and how these techniques are changing the face of JavaScript with ES6 and beyond.


## Outcomes

At the end of this course your team will have a solid introductory foundation to the essential parts of the JavaScript language and how these new skills can be applied to build the next generation of interactive web experiences. These skills will be fully demonstrated through an extensive array of workshop style coding examples adhering to industry best practices and patterns giving each student practical exercises and hands-on experience.

## Requirements

Students will be expected to already have some kind of programming language background and have been introduced to JavaScript and be comfortable with its general concepts. Each student will be required to have access to a personal computer with a text editor and Node.js installed for the length of the course.
