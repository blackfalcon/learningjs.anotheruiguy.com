# Functions and scope

A function is a "_subprogram_" that can be referenced by code external to another function. Values, called parameters, can be passed into the function body when called where the function will typically return a value to be used. Functions in JavaScript are first-class objects, because a function can have properties and methods the same as an object.

Another property of functions is their ability to manage scope. Understanding these principals is key for creating consistent and stable code.
