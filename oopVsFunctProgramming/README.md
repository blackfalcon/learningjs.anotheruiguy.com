# JavaScript and its many programming paradigms

Probably one of the hardest things to understand about JavaScript is that it is all the things all wrapped up in one. Some languages are strictly Object Oriented Programming (Java, Python, Ruby). While others are strictly Functional (Clojure, Erlang, Haskell). And then there is that other pesky one, Procedural (Basic, Cobol and Go). Then there the imperative and declarative.

And then there is ... JavaScipt.

> JavaScript, one of the world's most widely distributed languages, has the properties of an untyped functional language, in addition to imperative and object-oriented paradigms.


## Lesson outline

* What are the different programming paradigms
* The roots of JavaScript and Imperative(Procedural) programming styles
* Functional programming and ES6 style higher-order functions
* Object-oriented programming, the good, the bad and the ugly
