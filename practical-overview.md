# JavaScript for Professionals (practical overview)

JavaScript, the practical overview, consists of three individual day-long sessions. Each session will consist of education modules that includes topic discussion and workshop labs.

This course will focus on teaching software engineers the core concepts of modern JavaScript development. Students will quickly progress from foundational JavaScript concepts and move into the browser and beyond. JavaScript for Professionals instructional style is designed to help draw parallels between JavaScript and the student's current programming background.

## What you'll learn

**JavaScript Core Concepts:**
In this first session, students will be walked through the essentials of JavaScript. Material will quickly cover the foundational building blocks of the language and how they may differ from other languages.

**JavaScript in the Browser:**
In the second session, instruction will transition to JavaScript in the browser, its native home.

**Client-side App Development:**
In the last session students will be introduced to the vast array of modern web application tooling. Here students will dive deep into concepts including web performance, JavaScript software development cycles, build and deploy systems be introduced to modern web application development libraries, toolkits and frameworks.

## Outcomes

At the end of this course your team will have a solid introductory foundation to the essential parts of the JavaScript language and how these new skills can be applied to build the next generation of interactive web experiences. These skills will be fully demonstrated through an extensive array of workshop style coding examples adhering to industry best practices and patterns giving each student practical exercises and hands-on experience.

## Requirements

Students will be expected to already have some kind of programming language background and have been introduced to JavaScript and be comfortable with its general concepts. Each student will be required to have access to a personal computer with a text editor and Node.js installed for the length of the course.



## Session 1 (JavaScript Core Concepts)

JavaScript the Core Concepts. In this day long session students will focus on the core concepts of the language and how they operate. From understanding primitives data types to building complex functions, students will quickly master the core skills needed to build the next generation of web based apps.

1. Storing and tracking data √
1. Conditionals and loops √
1. What is this? √
1. Functions and scope √
1. ES6 functions and object destructuring √

### Optional advanced modules

1. Higher-order functions √
1. OOP versus Functional programming paradigms √

## Session 2 (JavaScript in the browser)

JavaScript in the Browser. In this day long session students will take what they have learned from the 1st module of lessons and start to apply them into an HTML document. Students will walk away with full understanding of the Document Object Model, event handling, DOM manipulation and API inclusion.

1. Intro to JS in the browser
	* Welcome to the browser, Window.object and the Document.object
	* Techniques for element selection and traversing the DOM
	* Creating event listeners
1. Data and the DOM
	* Event management, bubbling and delegation
	* Data API ingestion
	* Creating DOM elements, appending and remove DOM nodes
1. Front-end web performance
	* Core concepts of Front-end web optimization
1. Local data storage
	* Intro to JavaScript cookies and basic uses and limitations
	* Session and local storage

## Session 3 (Client-side App Development)

JavaScript has extended way past the idea of simply managing experiences in the browser. Not only is it in the front-end code we write, but is on the server as well as encompassing our entire development environment. Here students will be introduced to various tooling, build systems, deployment pipelines and JavaScript application frameworks.

1. Intro to JavaScript all around us
	* Welcome to Node.js and JavaScript on the server
	* JavaScript Node Package Management, aka npm
	* Intro to JavaScript task managers/build systems; grunt, gulp, webpack (syntax, strengths and weaknesses)
1. Asyc JavaScript
	* Async functionality and what that means in JavaScript (https://www.eventedmind.com/classes/the-javascript-runtime/asynchronous-code)
	* Promises and XHR
		* (https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/promises) / (https://dev.to/damcosset/i-promise-i-wont-callback-anymore-cp3)
1. How to use ES6 with legacy browsers
	* What are transpilers and how do they work?
	* Intro to Babel and Typescript
1. Intro to the JavaScript universe
	* Introductions to many of the top JavaScript libraries, utility toolkits and frameworks, the good, the bad and the ugly
	* JavaScript libraries; the landscape
		* React
