# The Interview

So we are here. The interview. This is where everything you know is being put to the test. The hardest part of the JavaScript interview is, you have NO IDEA where the questions will be coming from. You could either be grilled on the most complex algorithm concept there is, or be asked to write out a simple jQuery selector. Parse an array or validate a password. There is no way to study for everything that may come your way, but there are a few patterns that I have seen.

In all of the JavaScript questions I have been asked, there are some fundamental JavaScript skills I believe that they are looking for. How well do you understand the concepts of [Objects? Can you build a simple algorithm when given a small amount of data? Strings, arrays, for loops ... and things of that nature. The more you can come to grips with these core concepts, the more you easily understand the larger, more complex ideas of the language.

Sure, there will be a JavaScript super ego nerd who is quizzing you and the awesomeness of your code and will ding the hell out of you because your solution is too lengthy and there is a super cool new ES6 hight order function that you SHOULD HAVE USED ... but I digress. If you are up against that kind of ego, then maybe that's not the place for you anyway.

In this section I will decompose some of the common questions I have seen and the solutions I have come up with. Keep in mind, I have found that the majority of questions I have come across are easily answered by your ability to understand JavaScript primitives, and work with strings, arrays and loops. And if you can thrown in some higher order functions, that just makes it that much more awesome.
