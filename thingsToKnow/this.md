# this

`this` is one of the more confusing aspects of JAvaScript to a new comer. For the simple fact, that this is a very abstract concept.

To understand `this`, just remember; 'Context is King!'

Simply put, `this` is a contextual reference pertaining to the action being performed. The `this` keyword can be used to access values, methods and other objects that are context specific.

There are 4 ways that a `this` will get it's value

1. Within the context of a function
1. Within Methods and Objects
1. Within a Constructor
1. When a function is invoked via `.call()`, `.apply()` and `.bind()`
