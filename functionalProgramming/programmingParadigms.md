# JavaScript and its many programming paradigms

Probably one of the hardest things to understand about JavaScript is that it is all the things all wrapped up in one. Some languages are strictly Object Oriented Programming (Java, Python, Ruby). While others are strictly Functional (Clojure, Erlang, Haskell). And then there is that other pesky one, Procedural (Basic, Cobol and Go). Then there the imperative and declarative.

And then there is ... JavaScipt.

> JavaScript, one of the world's most widely distributed languages, has the properties of an untyped functional language, in addition to imperative and object-oriented paradigms.

JavaScript can be object-oriented, while at times be extremely functional. Reading through the code you will go from an imperative style and quickly jump to declarative. This can be really maddening, especially for anyone who is new to JavaScript. And extremely maddening for someone coming to JavaScript from a more disciplined language.

In this section, I will do my best to cover the basics of what these terms mean, how they may or may not cause side-effects or have an impact on the state.
