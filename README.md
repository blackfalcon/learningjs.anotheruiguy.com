# Surviving the JavaScript interview

If you haven't been paying attention to things lately, you may have noticed that almost all of modern application development has been dominated by JavaScript. It does not matter where you are in the stack, you will at some point be writing JavaScript.

And if you are in web development, you may have noticed that your whole world is being consumed by JavaScript. And if you are like me and have been around web development for a long time you also may be witnessing the dismissal of the other web standards we have fought for more than a decade to build upon.

You can either get on the train or be left in the station. I for one have never been about being left at the station. While I am in the lead car in this race, I am still in the race and I will do what I need to in order to keep racing.

JavaScript is here and it's not going anywhere. In fact, with latest ES6 updates, you could ague that JavaScript has come of age in regards to being considered a real programming language. So where does that put people like you and me? On the learning curve, that's where. And for some more so than others, that curve is steep as hell.

## Maybe this will help?

For me, learning comes in two forms; 1) daily practical use and 2) writing ...

In regards to JavaSscript, there is more to learn then there is daily practical uses. And the terminology, holy shit, the words that this community comes up with ... [closure](thingsToKnow/closure.html), [hoisting](thingsToKnow/hoisting.html), [callbacks](thingsToKnow/callbacks.html), [destructuring](thingsToKnow/destructuring.html), [Lambda functions](thingsToKnow/lamdaFunctions.html), [enumeration](thingsToKnow/enumeration.html), [currying](thingsToKnow/currying.html) and, the dreaded [Temporal Dead Zone](thingsToKnow/tdz.html).

And even worse, the [JavaScript interview!](interview/)

Learning JavaScript is a process of daily challenges. And what better way to challenge yourself than coming up with 1001 little exercises and self publishing them on the internets. I am NOT a JavaScript master or expert by any means, nor do I have a CS degree. But that has never stopped from learning something in the past and not stopping me from learning now.

Let's learn together!

### It's open source!

If you want to get involved in helping me write all of this, you are more then welcome. Also, I am my own editor. If you see anything wrong or a typo, please submit a pull request, or at the very least submit an issue that I can follow up with later!
